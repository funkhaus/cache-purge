# Cache Purge

This plugin will purge the entire cache at GraphCDN and/or Cloudflare on create/edit of posts, pages, menu items and attachments.

## Install

1.  Upload the files to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2.  Enter any settings on the plugins settings page. You don't need to set both Cloudflare and GraphCDN, just the one provider you need or both.
